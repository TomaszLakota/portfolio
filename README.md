# My Portofolio

## React

### [#1 Multiplayer Gaming Platform (games other than Checkers not included)](https://github.com/TomaszLakota/multiplayer-gaming-platform)
My first React project. It's a multiplayer online checkers with user authentication and login system. 
I've used React and Bootstrap libraries. Uses React Router, React Higher Order Components and websockets.
Could use some refactoring. 

### [Simple form with validation](https://github.com/TomaszLakota/react-form)
Form showcasing one of my first React projects. It needs a lot of refactoring, to name one all controls should be put into separate components, but that's dull, I have some better stuff coming up :)

### To Do List
Will be finished soon

### [Group project] [My Fridge app - nutrition plan, ingredients management and recipies](https://github.com/jatanski/myFridge)
Work in proggress, due to 6th of January 2020

### Secret project 
In early stages of development

## HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JS

### [Landing page](https://github.com/TomaszLakota/TomaszLakota.github.io)
Simple page developed using HTML5 and CSS3 (used BEM naming convention, but not Sass). Doesn't use any javascript, but uses some cool CSS animations made with transition and animation.

###[A random recruitment task I wrote half a year ago](https://github.com/TomaszLakota/operations-on-2d-array)
Nothing special really, just using plain JS to solve algorithmic problem; has a nice readme
