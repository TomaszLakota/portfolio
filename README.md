## React
### [#1 Multiplayer Gaming Platform (games other than Checkers not included)](https://github.com/TomaszLakota/multiplayer-gaming-platform)
My first React project. It's a multiplayer online checkers with user authentication and login system. 
I've used React and Bootstrap libraries. Uses React Router, React Higher Order Components and websockets.
Could use some refactoring. 

### [Simple form with validation](https://github.com/TomaszLakota/react-form)
Form showcasing one of my first React projects. It needs a lot of refactoring, to name one all controls should be put into separate components, but that's dull, I have some better stuff coming up :)
